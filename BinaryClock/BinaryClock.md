# Binary Clock

Within this tutorial you are going to create a binary clock using a micro:bit. Binary is a numbering system computers use.

you will keep track of the time by displayng the hours, minutes and seconds as seperate binary numbers on the micro:bit LED display.

## Reading the clock

To read the clock you start on the top row of LEDs, this row represents the hours.

Each column of LEDs represents a number. From right to left the columns are numbered 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16. By adding these 5 numbers you can get every value of a 24 hour clock.
