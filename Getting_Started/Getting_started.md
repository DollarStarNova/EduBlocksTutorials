# Getting Started

## What Is EduBlocks?
Edublocks is a program, which allows you to write real python code but in block format like Scratch, with this in mind it is helping educators teach younger children to program in python and by the time they are able to move on to python they will already understand the python syntax.

EduBlocks can be used with the Raspberry Pi, micro:bit, Adafruit Circuit Python boards like the Circuit Playground Express and Python3 within a web browser like Chrome.

## How To Install EduBlocks on The Raspberry Pi
EduBlocks does not come installed on the Raspberry Pi by default, so for us to install it we need to open a terminal window to do this by clicking on the icon that looks like this ![Terminal Icon](Images/Terminal.png) It is located at the top along from the menu icon.

Once the Terminal has opened you will see a window similar to this: ![Terminal Window](Images/Terminal_Window.png)

Now we need to type the following command:

```bash
curl -sSL connect.edublocks.org | bash
```
Once you have typed the line above press enter. Now we just have to wait till its finished.

Now type
```bash
edublocks-startup-enable
```
This will start EduBlocks when the Raspberry Pi starts up.

## Starting EduBlocks
Open any web browser on any system and type:
```
app.edublock.org
```
You will see the following screen:

Click on the mode that you want to use.

We will dig deeper into the different modes through other tutorials.
Until next time.
